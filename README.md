Wear Pack for Google Glass
===================



Overview
--------

The Wear Pack for Google Glass includes a sample inspection app that walks field technicians through a step-by-step inspection process. An inspection list is dynamically generated based on current location and inspection steps stored in a custom object in Salesforce. Technicians use voice commands to record responses in Salesforce (e.g., Yes/No, Pass/Fail), capture photos, create trouble tickets (Cases) and search Salesforce Knowledge documentation. The app uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users with Salesforce and the Force.com REST API to query and update data.


This sample application is part of the <a href="http://developer.salesforce.com/wear" target="_blank">Salesforce Wear Developer Pack</a>, a collection of open-source starter apps that let you quickly design and build wearable apps that connect to the Salesforce1 Platform.
